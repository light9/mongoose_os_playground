# A simple Playground app

## Overview

This app exposes more functionality to the RPC features of Mongoose OS.

It's compatible exclusively with the ESP32 dev boards (Wemos LOLIN32, mostly).
A ESP8266 is available [here](https://github.com/pmanna/mongoose_os_playground8266).

It's supposed to work with a yet unnamed mobile app, similar to [Blynk](http://www.blynk.cc), but for local communication.

The app has been developed as a support for the [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com) Ninjas' projects at Croke Park, Dublin.

## How to install this app

- Install and start [mos tool](https://mongoose-os.com/software.html)
- Follow instructions in [Mongoose OS Docs](https://mongoose-os.com/docs/book/build.html)
